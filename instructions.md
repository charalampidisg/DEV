### Explanation of Each File and Its Use Case

#### `DataCollectingServant.java`
This class implements the `DataCollectorOperations` interface and acts as a servant to collect data from various sources. It uses an `EventQueue` to handle data processing asynchronously and forwards the data to the appropriate DAO for persistence.

**Use Case**: This class is used to receive and process data from different sources, such as PLC adapters, and forward it to the database.

#### `DatabaseDataCollector.java`
This class sets up the CORBA environment, including the ORB (Object Request Broker), POA (Portable Object Adapter), and NamingContext. It initializes the `DataCollectingServant` and binds it to the CORBA naming service.

**Use Case**: This class is used to initialize and run the CORBA server that hosts the `DataCollectingServant`.

#### `SupplyAreaDAO.java`
This interface defines the methods for accessing and manipulating data related to supply areas. It provides a contract that different DAO implementations must follow.

**Use Case**: This interface is used to define the operations for persisting supply area data, ensuring that different implementations adhere to the same contract.

#### `CorbaServantResolver.java`
This interface defines a method for resolving CORBA servants. It is used to obtain a reference to a remote CORBA servant.

**Use Case**: This interface is used to resolve and obtain references to remote CORBA servants, ensuring that the correct servant is used for data forwarding.

#### `CorbaSupplyAreaDAO.java`
This class implements the `SupplyAreaDAO` interface and uses CORBA to forward data to a remote `DataCollectingServant`. It handles the resolution of the remote servant and forwards data asynchronously.

**Use Case**: This class is used to forward supply area data to a remote `DataCollectingServant` using CORBA.

#### `OracleSupplyAreaDAO.java`
This class implements the `SupplyAreaDAO` interface for Oracle databases. It contains the actual code to interact with an Oracle database, such as SQL queries and connection handling.

**Use Case**: This class is used to persist supply area data in an Oracle database.

#### `db_collector.idl`
This IDL (Interface Definition Language) file defines the CORBA interfaces for the `DataCollector` and `SupplyAreaDataCollector`. It specifies the methods that these interfaces must implement.

**Use Case**: This file is used to define the CORBA interfaces and methods for data collection and persistence.

### Leveraging These Files

1. **Initialize CORBA Environment**: Use `DatabaseDataCollector.java` to set up the CORBA environment and initialize the `DataCollectingServant`.

2. **Implement New PLC Message**: Create a new message format for the PLC to send the required data. Ensure the message includes timestamps for when the pickstation was blocked.

3. **Forward Data**: Implement a class in the PLC adapter to forward the raw data to the `dbcollector` process. Use `CorbaSupplyAreaDAO` to resolve the `DataCollectingServant` and forward the data.

4. **Persist Data**: Use `OracleSupplyAreaDAO` to persist the data in the Oracle database.



Summary of the roles of each component:

- **`SupplyAreaDAO`**: This is the main interface that defines the methods for accessing and manipulating data related to supply areas.

- **`CorbaSupplyAreaDAO`**: This class implements the `SupplyAreaDAO` interface and is used to forward data from the PLC adapter to the `DataCollectingServant` using CORBA.

- **`DataCollectingServant`**: This class implements the `DataCollectorOperations` interface and acts as a servant to collect data from various sources. It uses an `EventQueue` to handle data processing asynchronously and forwards the data to the appropriate DAO for persistence.

- **`OracleSupplyAreaDAO`**: This class implements the `SupplyAreaDAO` interface for Oracle databases. It contains the actual code to interact with an Oracle database and persist the data.

In summary, the `PLC adapter` uses `CorbaSupplyAreaDAO` to forward data to the `DataCollectingServant`, which then uses `OracleSupplyAreaDAO` to persist the data in the database.

The `DataCollectingServant` does not have `CorbaSupplyAreaDAO` because its primary role is to persist data in the database. The `OracleSupplyAreaDAO` is used for direct database interactions, which is the final step in the data collection process.

The `CorbaSupplyAreaDAO` is used by the PLC adapter to forward data to the `DataCollectingServant`. Once the data reaches the `DataCollectingServant`, it uses `OracleSupplyAreaDAO` to persist the data in the database.

Here is a summary of the flow:
1. **PLC Adapter**: Uses `CorbaSupplyAreaDAO` to forward data to `DataCollectingServant`.
2. **DataCollectingServant**: Receives the data and uses `OracleSupplyAreaDAO` to persist it in the database.

This separation ensures that the `DataCollectingServant` focuses on data persistence, while the `CorbaSupplyAreaDAO` handles the communication between the PLC adapter and the `DataCollectingServant`.

### **StationBaseListener**
The `StationBaseListener` is an interface that defines the methods to be called when a message is received. It acts as the target for the CORBA call, meaning it contains the business logic that should be executed in response to the incoming message. Essentially, the `listener` is the object that will handle the actual processing of the message.

### **AMI_StationBaseListenerHandler**
The `AMI_StationBaseListenerHandler` is used for asynchronous method invocation (AMI). AMI allows methods to be called asynchronously, meaning the caller does not have to wait for the method to complete before continuing with other tasks. The `amiHandler` is responsible for managing the asynchronous communication, ensuring that the method invocation is handled correctly and efficiently.

### **Why Both Are Needed**
1. **Listener**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains the business logic to process the message.
   - **Role**: Executes the method defined in the `StationBaseListener` interface when a message is received.

2. **AMI Handler**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages asynchronous communication.
   - **Role**: Ensures that the method invocation is handled asynchronously, allowing the system to continue processing other tasks without waiting for the method to complete.

### **How They Work Together**
When a TLV message is received, the `handleTLV` method retrieves both the `listener` and the `amiHandler`:
- The `listener` is used to execute the business logic defined in the `StationBaseListener` interface.
- The `amiHandler` is used to manage the asynchronous communication, ensuring that the method invocation is handled efficiently.

### **Example Scenario**
Imagine you have a PLC system that sends a message to start a motor. The `listener` contains the logic to start the motor, while the `amiHandler` ensures that the command to start the motor is sent asynchronously. This way, the system can continue processing other tasks while the motor is being started.

### **Code Context**
In the provided code snippet:
```java
final StationBaseListener listener = holder.getInvocationTarget();
final AMI_StationBaseListenerHandler amiHandler = holder.getAMI_Handler();
```
- `listener`: Retrieves the object that will handle the message.
- `amiHandler`: Retrieves the handler that will manage the asynchronous communication.

By using both the `listener` and the `amiHandler`, the system ensures that messages are processed correctly and efficiently, leveraging the benefits of asynchronous communication.

To persist the jam status data in the database, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a table to store the jam status data with columns for the station ID, start time, and end time.
2. Modify the `OraclePlcStationReplyDAO` class to handle the persistence logic.

Here is an example of how you can create the table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE JamStatus (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    station_id INT NOT NULL,
    start_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    end_time TIMESTAMP
);
```

Next, you can modify the `OraclePlcStationReplyDAO` class to handle the persistence logic. You will need to add methods to insert a new jam status record when a jam starts and update the record when the jam ends.

Here is an example of how you can modify the `OraclePlcStationReplyDAO` class:

```java
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Timestamp;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
```

```java
    private Logger logger;
    private Connection connection;
    private Map<Integer, Timestamp> activeJams;

    public OraclePlcStationReplyDAO(Connection connection) {
        if (connection == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("DB Connection may not be null");
        }
        this.logger = LogManager.getLogger(OraclePlcStationReplyDAO.class);
        this.connection = connection;
        this.activeJams = new HashMap<>();
    }
```

```java
    @Override
    public void jamStatus(int sourceStationId, int position, boolean active, Any errorInfo) {
        try {
            if (active) {
                // Insert new jam status record
                String sql = "INSERT INTO JamStatus (station_id, start_time) VALUES (?, ?)";
                try (PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {
                    stmt.setInt(1, sourceStationId);
                    Timestamp startTime = new Timestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
                    stmt.setTimestamp(2, startTime);
                    stmt.executeUpdate();
                    activeJams.put(sourceStationId, startTime);
                }
            } else {
                // Update existing jam status record
                String sql = "UPDATE JamStatus SET end_time = ? WHERE station_id = ? AND start_time = ?";
                try (PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {
                    Timestamp endTime = new Timestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
                    stmt.setTimestamp(1, endTime);
                    stmt.setInt(2, sourceStationId);
                    stmt.setTimestamp(3, activeJams.get(sourceStationId));
                    stmt.executeUpdate();
                    activeJams.remove(sourceStationId);
                }
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            logger.error("Failed to persist jam status", e);
        }
    }
```

This code will insert a new record when a jam starts and update the record with the end time when the jam ends. The `activeJams` map is used to keep track of the start times of active jams.
