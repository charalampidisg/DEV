### Explanation of Each File and Its Use Case

#### `DataCollectingServant.java`
This class implements the `DataCollectorOperations` interface and acts as a servant to collect data from various sources. It uses an `EventQueue` to handle data processing asynchronously and forwards the data to the appropriate DAO for persistence.

**Use Case**: This class is used to receive and process data from different sources, such as PLC adapters, and forward it to the database.

#### `DatabaseDataCollector.java`
This class sets up the CORBA environment, including the ORB (Object Request Broker), POA (Portable Object Adapter), and NamingContext. It initializes the `DataCollectingServant` and binds it to the CORBA naming service.

**Use Case**: This class is used to initialize and run the CORBA server that hosts the `DataCollectingServant`.

#### `SupplyAreaDAO.java`
This interface defines the methods for accessing and manipulating data related to supply areas. It provides a contract that different DAO implementations must follow.

**Use Case**: This interface is used to define the operations for persisting supply area data, ensuring that different implementations adhere to the same contract.

#### `CorbaServantResolver.java`
This interface defines a method for resolving CORBA servants. It is used to obtain a reference to a remote CORBA servant.

**Use Case**: This interface is used to resolve and obtain references to remote CORBA servants, ensuring that the correct servant is used for data forwarding.

#### `CorbaSupplyAreaDAO.java`
This class implements the `SupplyAreaDAO` interface and uses CORBA to forward data to a remote `DataCollectingServant`. It handles the resolution of the remote servant and forwards data asynchronously.

**Use Case**: This class is used to forward supply area data to a remote `DataCollectingServant` using CORBA.

#### `OracleSupplyAreaDAO.java`
This class implements the `SupplyAreaDAO` interface for Oracle databases. It contains the actual code to interact with an Oracle database, such as SQL queries and connection handling.

**Use Case**: This class is used to persist supply area data in an Oracle database.

#### `db_collector.idl`
This IDL (Interface Definition Language) file defines the CORBA interfaces for the `DataCollector` and `SupplyAreaDataCollector`. It specifies the methods that these interfaces must implement.

**Use Case**: This file is used to define the CORBA interfaces and methods for data collection and persistence.

### Leveraging These Files

1. **Initialize CORBA Environment**: Use `DatabaseDataCollector.java` to set up the CORBA environment and initialize the `DataCollectingServant`.

2. **Implement New PLC Message**: Create a new message format for the PLC to send the required data. Ensure the message includes timestamps for when the pickstation was blocked.

3. **Forward Data**: Implement a class in the PLC adapter to forward the raw data to the `dbcollector` process. Use `CorbaSupplyAreaDAO` to resolve the `DataCollectingServant` and forward the data.

4. **Persist Data**: Use `OracleSupplyAreaDAO` to persist the data in the Oracle database.



Summary of the roles of each component:

- **`SupplyAreaDAO`**: This is the main interface that defines the methods for accessing and manipulating data related to supply areas.

- **`CorbaSupplyAreaDAO`**: This class implements the `SupplyAreaDAO` interface and is used to forward data from the PLC adapter to the `DataCollectingServant` using CORBA.

- **`DataCollectingServant`**: This class implements the `DataCollectorOperations` interface and acts as a servant to collect data from various sources. It uses an `EventQueue` to handle data processing asynchronously and forwards the data to the appropriate DAO for persistence.

- **`OracleSupplyAreaDAO`**: This class implements the `SupplyAreaDAO` interface for Oracle databases. It contains the actual code to interact with an Oracle database and persist the data.

In summary, the `PLC adapter` uses `CorbaSupplyAreaDAO` to forward data to the `DataCollectingServant`, which then uses `OracleSupplyAreaDAO` to persist the data in the database.

The `DataCollectingServant` does not have `CorbaSupplyAreaDAO` because its primary role is to persist data in the database. The `OracleSupplyAreaDAO` is used for direct database interactions, which is the final step in the data collection process.

The `CorbaSupplyAreaDAO` is used by the PLC adapter to forward data to the `DataCollectingServant`. Once the data reaches the `DataCollectingServant`, it uses `OracleSupplyAreaDAO` to persist the data in the database.

Here is a summary of the flow:
1. **PLC Adapter**: Uses `CorbaSupplyAreaDAO` to forward data to `DataCollectingServant`.
2. **DataCollectingServant**: Receives the data and uses `OracleSupplyAreaDAO` to persist it in the database.

This separation ensures that the `DataCollectingServant` focuses on data persistence, while the `CorbaSupplyAreaDAO` handles the communication between the PLC adapter and the `DataCollectingServant`.
