### Merge Conflicts

To check if merging the `bugfix/dops-288966` branch into `group/develop` is possible without actually completing the merge, you can use the `git merge --no-commit --no-ff` command. This allows you to identify any conflicts that may need resolution. Here are the steps:

1. **Checkout the Target Branch (`group/develop`):**
   ```bash
   git checkout group/develop
   ```

2. **Attempt a No-Commit, No-Fast-Forward Merge:**
   ```bash
   git merge --no-commit --no-ff bugfix/dops-288966
   ```

3. **Check for Conflicts (check section Understanding the Output for more details)** 
   - If there are conflicts, Git will display messages indicating the conflicted files.
   - If there are no conflicts, Git will stage the changes for commit but will not complete the merge.

4. **Abort the Merge (if necessary):**
   ```bash
   git merge --abort
   ```
### If any Conflicts arise

1. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository**

 ```bash
 git fetch
 ```  
2. **Create a new branch based on group/develop**

 ```bash
git checkout -b merge/bugfix/dops-288966 group/develop
```
3. **Take care of the merge conflicts in the new merge branch**

### Understanding the Output of git merge
   
- **No Conflicts:** Git outputs something like "Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested."
- **With Conflicts:** Git lists conflicted files, e.g., "CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in `<file_name>`."

1. **Listing Conflicted Files:**
   - Conflicted files are shown in the console output.

2. **Viewing Conflict Details:**
   - Open conflicted files to see conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
   - To list only the conflicted files, use:
     ```bash
     git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
     ```
   - To list general info, use:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```
     
3. **Detailed Differences:**
   - For specific differences in conflicted files, use:
     ```bash
     git diff <file_name>
     ```
     
4. **Abort the Merge (if necessary):**
   ```bash
   git merge --abort
   ```

### Conflict Markers in Files

In conflicted files, you'll see markers like:

```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Changes from group/develop
=======
# Changes from bugfix/dops-288966
>>>>>>> bugfix/dops-288966
```

- **`<<<<<<< HEAD`:** Start of changes from the current branch (`group/develop`).
- **`=======`:** Separation of changes from both branches.
- **`>>>>>>> bugfix/dops-288966`:** End of changes from the `bugfix/dops-288966` branch.

Resolve conflicts by editing these sections and then mark them resolved:

```bash
git add <file_name>
```
Once you have resolved every conflict

```bash
git commit
git push
```
