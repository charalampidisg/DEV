Sure, let's clarify the difference between skeletons and stubs in the context of CORBA and IDL.

### **Stubs**
- **Client-Side**: Stubs are generated on the client side.
- **Purpose**: They act as a proxy for the remote server object. When a client invokes a method on the stub, the stub handles the communication details to send the request to the server.
- **Function**: Stubs marshal (convert) the method parameters into a format suitable for transmission over the network, send the request to the server, and then unmarshal (convert back) the response from the server.

### **Skeletons**
- **Server-Side**: Skeletons are generated on the server side.
- **Purpose**: They act as a proxy for the server object, receiving requests from the client stubs.
- **Function**: Skeletons unmarshal the incoming request, invoke the appropriate method on the server object, and marshal the response back to the client.

### **Workflow Example**
1. **Client Invocation**:
   - The client calls a method on the stub.
   - The stub marshals the parameters and sends the request to the server.

2. **Server Handling**:
   - The skeleton receives the request, unmarshals the parameters, and invokes the method on the server object.
   - The server object processes the request and returns the result.

3. **Response**:
   - The skeleton marshals the response and sends it back to the client stub.
   - The stub unmarshals the response and returns it to the client application.

### **Visual Representation**
```
Client Application
      |
      | (Method Call)
      v
Client Stub (Marshals parameters, sends request)
      |
      | (Network Communication)
      v
Server Skeleton (Unmarshals request, invokes method)
      |
      | (Method Execution)
      v
Server Object (Processes request, returns result)
      |
      | (Network Communication)
      v
Client Stub (Unmarshals response, returns result)
      |
      | (Method Return)
      v
Client Application
```

### **Summary**
- **Stubs**: Client-side proxies that handle communication with the server.
- **Skeletons**: Server-side proxies that handle incoming requests from the client.
